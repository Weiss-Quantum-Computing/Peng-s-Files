# Peng-s-Files
Inside this repository are the Mathematica scripts and circuit designs used during my PhD.
Mathematica Files:
1. OpticalLatticePotential.nb       calculation of state-dependent lattice and controlled collisions
2. WeightingFunction_SpinEcho.nb    analyze the spin echo sequence as a noise filter
3. Tune-out.nb                      calculate the tune-out frequency of the new qubit basis
4. Two_Photon_Transition.nb         analyze the two-photon transition 

Compressed Files:
1. CurrentStabilization: feedback circuit used to stabilize the current of bias coils (not used in the experiment)
2. MNS_V3: magnetic lock circuit (the values of resistors and capacitors in the current setup may vary from the values in the file)
