# Peng-s-Files
Inside this repository are the Mathematica scripts and circuit designs used during my PhD.
Mathematica Files:
1. OpticalLatticePotential.nb       calculation of state-dependent lattice and controlled collisions
2. WeightingFunction_SpinEcho.nb    analyze the spin echo sequence as a noise filter
3. Tune-out.nb                      calculate the tune-out frequency of the new qubit basis
4. Two_Photon_Transition.nb         analyze the two-photon transition
